##  Overview

The Decathlon Support System is a comprehensive software project designed to streamline and enhance the data recording processes during a decathlon event. The core functionalities of the project are facilitated through a Next.js frontend, a Rust backend, and a reverse proxy orchestrated using Docker Compose. The backend offers features such as logging, web server capabilities, serialization, PDF generation, and AWS service interaction. Through components like certificate_generation.rs, the system manages athlete achievements, facilitates CRUD operations for athletes, groups, and achievements, thereby significantly enhancing operational efficiency within the Decathlon Support System architecture.

##  Features

|    |   Feature         | Description |
|----|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚙️  | **Architecture**  | The project follows a microservices architecture. It uses Next.js for the frontend, Rust for the backend, and a reverse proxy. Services are orchestrated in a compose.yaml file for seamless inter-service communication.|
| 🔩 | **Code Quality**  | The codebase exhibits good code quality with adherence to best practices. It maintains consistent code style and follows standards.|
| 📄 | **Documentation** | The project provides detailed documentation for setting up and running the system. It includes explanations for backend Rust code, npm scripts, and containerization. The documentation supports developers in understanding and contributing to the project effectively. |
| 🧩 | **Modularity**    | The codebase demonstrates modularity with separate frontend and backend services. Components are organized and decoupled, allowing for easy maintainability and reusability.|
| 🧪 | **Testing**       | Testing frameworks such as Jest and React Testing Library are used for frontend testing. Backend code is tested using Rust's built-in testing capabilities.|
| ⚡️  | **Performance**   | The system shows good efficiency and speed. Resource usage is managed effectively through containerized deployment and optimization in the Dockerfile.|
| 🛡️ | **Security**      | Security measures include access control mechanisms for data protection. Backend services handle authentication using Next-Auth for secure user access.|
| 📦 | **Dependencies**  | Key dependencies include Next.js, Rust, TailwindCSS, Docker, Next-Auth, and Zod for data validation. External libraries like React and TypeScript are also used.|
| 🚀 | **Scalability**   | The project is designed for scalability with a microservices architecture. It can handle increased traffic and load by scaling individual services independently.|
